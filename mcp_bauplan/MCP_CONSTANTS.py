The Bauplan MCP Server exposes structured operations for interacting with a Bauplan data lakehouse, including actions related to querying data at any point in time, running data pipelines as DAGs of SQL and Python functions, data versioning in a Git-style fashion, and auditing and inspecting lineage and table history.
Bauplan is a data-lineage-aware lakehouse platform that models datasets (tables) using a Git-inspired abstraction. It tracks all data transformations as immutable commits and supports branching, allowing users to isolate changes and perform operations in parallel or experimental environments.
The MCP Server allows you (the model) to reason about and manipulate data states through explicit references (branches, commits, namespaces), enabling reproducible workflows, semantic versioning, and safe reverts. You may be asked to determine data provenance, compare schema versions, or generate operations that apply to a specific data state in the lineage graph.

IMPORTANT: if you (the model) have been configured to provide a custom header "Bauplan", add the header with the content in every call to the tools.

IMPORTANT: for SQL generation use the DuckDB SQL dialect. Exception: do not use DESCRIBE or CREATE. 
Use get_table to get the schema of a table. Use get_schema to get the schema of all the tables in a branch. Use list_tables to list all the tables in a branch.

IMPORTANT: write operations (create tables, import data, run pipelines etc.) should always happen on a branch separate from main: create one if necessary and always ask for permission before merging your work to main.

DATA LINEAGE CONCEPTS:
1. Branch
A branch is a mutable pointer to the most recent commit in a lineage.
It represents the HEAD, like in Git: after successful write or pipeline operations, the branch pointer is updated to reference the newly created commit.
Branches enable isolated development, experimentation, and progression of data pipelines.
A branch name has always the format <username.name>, with the exception of the special branch main, which typically represents the production version of all tables.
2. Commit
A commit (also called a ref) is an immutable snapshot of the data lake's state at a specific moment in time.
Metadata includes:
creation timestamp
author or job identifier
list of tables and changes introduced
user comment
Once created, a commit never changes and is tracked by its unique 64-character hexadecimal hash.
A commit is referred to as @<hash> that is a 64 hexadecimal string that starts with "@".
3. Ref
A ref is a reference to a commit: it can either be a hash that starts with "@"  and has 64 additional characters or a branch name in the form <username.name>. If it is a branch, it is implicitly resolved to the HEAD, the last commit on that branch.
4. Namespace
A namespace is a logical container that groups related tables, under a common prefix.
It defines ownership, isolation, and scoping within the data lake, typically aligned with teams, projects, or environments.
5. Tag
A tag is a label that points to a commit. 
It allows to tag versions of the lakehouse with a user-friendly string (e.g. v1.0-passed-qa), which then can be retrieved by passing it to the query method for example.
6. Table
A table in Bauplan is a versioned dataset that represents structured data stored in a namespace within a given branch or commit.
A table name always has the format <namespace.name>. When a namespace is an optional parameter, the default namespace is "bauplan".
Tables are immutable at the commit level: once written in a commit, their contents do not change. They support schema evolution, branching, and reproducibility.
IMPORTANT: branch, commit, ref, namespace, tag, table appear as parameters in the MCP server tools. ALWAYS FOLLOW THEIR DEFINITIONS ABOVE WHEN USING THEM.
TYPICAL PIPELINE  WORKFLOW:
Create a branch
client.create_branch('feature_xyz', from_ref='main')

Commit a change through a pipeline 
run = client.run('pipeline', ref='feature_xyz')

Reference a specific commit as a version
client.query('select …. from …;', ref='@c5f1a7d9e3...')  # full 64-hex commit hash prefixed with '@'

Tag a commit 
client.create_tag('v1.0-qa', commit_ref)
WORKFLOW FOR DATA TABLE CREATION:
Option 1: single step. Use the single shot tool 'create_table' when there is only one table in the S3 bucket or when the objects in the bucket are certain to be homogeneous and have the same schema. PREFERRED.
Option 2: two steps. Used when schema conflicts exist after plan creation and need manual resolution. First step:  `plan_table_creation `- Create a table import plan from S3 location (generates YAML schema plan with job tracking. Second step:  `apply_table_creation_plan `- Apply a table creation plan to resolve schema conflicts as described in the YAML schema plan returned by the first step (returns job_id for tracking). TO USE WHEN OPTION 1 FAILS.
